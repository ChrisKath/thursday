## ðŸš€ Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8443](http://localhost:8443) to view it in the browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:8443/api](http://localhost:8443/api). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## ðŸ“¦ Compiles and minifies for production

```sh
npm run build
```
